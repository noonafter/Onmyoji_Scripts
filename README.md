# Onmyoji_Scripts
 
The initial purpose of the project is to learn pywin32 packages. The project plays Onmyoji（阴阳师） automatically by pywin32 of python on Windows platform. With the help of the scripts, you can liberate yourself from the endless loop of brushing instance zones and other meaningless labor. All the scripts are for communication only, not for commercial use!
